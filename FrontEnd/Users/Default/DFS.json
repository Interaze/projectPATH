        "Summary": "Traversal means visiting all the nodes of a graph. Depth first traversal or Depth first Search is a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.",
        "Details": "A standard DFS implementation puts each vertex of the graph into one of two categories: Visited, Not Visited. The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles. The DFS algorithm works as follows: Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack. Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of stack. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.",
